# ColourMixFinder
This tool finds the closest (pairwise) mix from the colours you own to a target colour. To use this, you just need to write a list of available hex codes in the array called 'my_colors', and change 'target_color' to the color you want to obtain. After you run this code, you will get the two best colors to mix, and the proportion (with a maximum dilution of 1/6) of each.
### TODO:
- Allow to introduce citadel color name instead of hex code using existing csv file
- Allow mixing more than two colors at once
